# DJS04 Project Brief: Book Connect - Abstractions


Discussion and Reflection

During my experience converting the book preview and other elements into Web Components, I faced a few challenges. Initially, I struggled to fully understand how Web Components work. Despite watching several tutorials and videos, it took me some time to grasp the key concepts. However, with enough guidance and practice, I started getting the hang of it, though I’m still not entirely confident in my understanding yet.

In terms of the elements I chose for conversion, I focused on those that seemed like they would benefit most from the encapsulation and reusability that Web Components offer. This helped me better understand when and why to use them in a project.

Through this exercise, I started to learn more about Web Components, like how they can enhance maintainability and modularity in development. Despite these challenges, I’m confident that with continued use, I’ll improve my understanding and proficiency over time.
